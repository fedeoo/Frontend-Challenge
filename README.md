# challenge myself

This repo aims for collecting some challenged tasks and complete them.
You could complete them by yourself just as a programming workouts.  Or you can choose them as a question in [pair programming interviews](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/things-ive-learned-from-pair-programming-interviews-35a4db7d7443).
Some of them are marked as ‚≠ê, which means I was asked to implement it in an interview.

Tips:
1. **DO NOT** rely on any library or tools but you don't need to consider old browser.
2. You'd better complete it with valina JS in given time.  Complete them by yourself.
 

## Perfection Game ‚≠êÔ∏è

Time: 1 hour   
Desc: You could simplify the game by ignoring the timer and assuming that shapes are infinite. 

## Virtual DOM Diff ‚≠ê
In this version, we don't consider `key`. Given the data structure like this, 
```
const rawTree = {
  tag: 'ul',
  children: [{
    tag: 'li',
    children: 'üçé',
  }, {
    tag: 'li',
    children: 'üçá',
  }],
};
```
We could do this step by step:
1. Render whole tree in page.
2. Copy`rawTree` to `addedItemTree` and add a new item. then add a button in page, 
when given button was clicked, then render this tree again. Ensure the old dom won't be rendered more than once.
3. Copy `rawTree` to `removedItemTree` and remove last item, then add a button in page,
when given button was clicked, then render this tree again. Ensure the first item be rendered.
4. Copy `rawTree` to `modifiedItemTree` and modify one item, then same as above.

Time: It depends on the how many features you want to complete.  

## Reactivity
The core of Vue.js is reactivity system. If you are working with Vue.js or Mobx, it's essential to dig out what happen behind these frameworks.
Also, it's a great chance for TDD.  Assume you're using Jest.

1. Add this test and it should be fail at first, then make it pass. 
```
const callback = jest.fn();
const todos = {
  count: 0
};
observe(todos, callback);
todos.count = 1;
expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
```  

2.  Add test for creating Vue

```js
const render = jest.fn();
const app = new Vue({
  data: {
    count: 0,
  },
  render,
});
app.count = 1;
expect(render).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

3. dependency collection 
This task is little bit tricky. You have to consider about dependency collection.
```
const render = jest.fn(function() {
  console.log(this.count);
});
const app = new Vue({
  data: {
    todo: 'wake up',
    count: 0,
  },
  render,
});
app.count = 1;
expect(render).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);
app.todo = 'sleep';
expect(render).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```
